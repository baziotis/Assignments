# Assignment 3
In short: Implement DTW algorithm in O(N) time and space complexity. This implementation actually has O(c) time and space complexity,
where 'c' is the constraint given for the DTW window. Furthermore, this is only the dynamic programming implementation.

You can find a more detailed description (in Greek) in the description pdf.
